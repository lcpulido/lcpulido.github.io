A personal website for myself and the world to see. I will be using this to display a bio, contact information, and as a way to better my programming skills. Feel free to reuse some or all of it to help you in building your own site. Made with Bootstrap and HTML. 

 *Navigation bar helps you connect to me. Clicking on my name Logo brings you to my github page as well.
